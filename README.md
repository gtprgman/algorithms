# algorithms
this repository will include implementation of any algorithm that I found to be useful and worth to be published.
The BiSEEK.java is totally refactored from the TestBinSearch.java which I had previously posted on this git.
The refactored version can implement binary search algorithm on a given set/collection without the need of dynamically allocating memory from the R.A.M.
and so without the neccessity of prior indexing the set before applying the binary search function. It's expected to be more efficient in performing the 
search within a given set. But in overall it's still needed further development on performing the search that involving several records that have the 
same value of a particular key.
