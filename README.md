# algorithms
this repository will include implementation of any algorithm that I found to be useful and worth to be published.

BiSEEK.java : a refactored version from TestBinSearch.java ( no indexing & no dynamic memory allocation ).
TestBinSearch.java : demonstrates binary search function acting over dynamically shrinking buffer.
BooksCat.java : demonstrates insertion sort algorithm sorting on a set/collection.
JMerges.java : demonstrates Merge Sort Algorithm.
